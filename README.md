# Transforming-EDAs-to-Dashboards-Data-Visualization-Tools
Project Title: Transforming EDA to Dashboard â€“ Data Visualization Tool
Project Description
This project focuses on taking a cleaned dataset, performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and converting the insights into an interactive, user-friendly dashboard using Tableau. The goal is to make raw data understandable through effective visualization techniques so that key insights can be quickly grasped by stakeholders from different backgrounds.

The project is structured in stages:

First, the dataset is cleaned and transformed to remove errors and inconsistencies.

Then, detailed EDA is done to understand patterns and relationships in the data.

Based on the EDA, a dashboard is created using Tableau, focusing on clarity, design, and insightfulness.

Finally, a 15-minute video is made to explain how the dashboard works, what insights are derived, and how it can be used.
